1. Flint Water Crisis: 
Investigated and analyzed the Flint Water Crisis, which led over 100,000 residents to elevated lead level and 12,000 children were exposed to drinking water with high level of lead, by applying an exponential decay function to model our data using a regression.

2. House Prices Predictions with Statistical Learning Techniques:
Observed and Discovered insightful information and stories behind the dataset, which is given 80 characteristics of nearly 1,500 houses, to deliver a relatively efficient data preprocessing.
Applied 9 evaluation methods (KNN, Linear Regression, Subset Selection, Shrinkage Methods, Generalized Additive Models, Regression Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting) and models to predict the selling price of these 1,500 houses. 

3. Titanic Survivorsâ€™ Prediction:
Attempted to answer questions in whether or not the survivors of the Titanic disaster can be accurately predicted based on their features and which features are more significant to the outcome of a passenger by exploring 2 datasets with 2,476 and 1,309 samples, separately. 
Utilized 4 computational techniques (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Neural Network) to generate the top 4 among 8 total features, which contributed the surviving situation of a person, and improve accuracies.

4. Urine Data Analysis in Frequentist and Bayesian Framework:
Analyzed the 79 urine samples with the comparison in Frequentist and Bayesian Frameworks to figure out which of the physical characteristices of the urine might be related to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals.
